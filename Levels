<br>
<h2 align="center">Changing levels</h2>
<p align="center">
    Levels or paths, are controlled by PathController, where they are stored.<br>
    Everytime path needs to be changed, like when player completes the level, path index is changed and new path is spawned, and the old one destroyed.<br>
    This new path is stored as new path and the one that was destroyed as a old one.<br>
    Path changing also works in reverse, when player fails, previous path will be loaded and currect destroyed.
</p>

<br>
<h2 align="center">Platforms</h2>
<p align="center">
    In order to add variety, diffrent types of platforms were added, where platforms are blocks that create a path.<br>
    1| StartPlatform - first platform in the path, must always be black to ensure nice, smooth transition.<br>
    2| Platform - base platform with no effects.<br>
    3| IcePlatform - block of ice that makes player slip, increasing difficulty of given path.<br>
    4| JumpWall - wall an ability to make player stick to it, and reset jump count.<br>
    5| BouncePlatform - trampoline that bounces player with a given strength.<br>
    6| EndPlatform - platform with medicine, main destination in each path.
